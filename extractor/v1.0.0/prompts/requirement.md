### âœ… Project Idea: Electron App to Extract Video Stream and Play Externally

**Objective:**
Iâ€™m building a desktop application using **Electron.js** that can extract playable video stream links from streaming websites and then forward them to an external media player like **VLC**. This enables a smooth, ad-free viewing experience for the user.

---

### ðŸ”§ How It Works:

1. **Electron App** loads the target website in a browser window.
2. It uses `webRequest` or the Chrome DevTools Protocol to **monitor all network requests** made by the website.
3. The app detects actual media stream URLs (such as `.mp4` or `.m3u8`) from those network requests.
4. Once a valid video stream is detected, the app:

   * Displays the link to the user
   * OR automatically opens the stream in an **external player** (like VLC or mpv)
5. The external player plays the video **directly from the source**, avoiding ads, popups, and trackers.

### ðŸ“¦ Technologies Used:

* **Electron.js** â€“ Desktop app framework
* **Node.js** â€“ To interact with system processes
* **BrowserWindow + session.webRequest** â€“ To load web pages and intercept network activity
* **Child Process API** â€“ To launch external video players

---

### ðŸ”’ Notes:

* The app does **not** download any video.
* It just **extracts the actual playable stream URL** and passes it to a media player.
* This is similar to what extensions like **Video DownloadHelper** do in the browser.

---

### ðŸ’¡ Benefits:

* Cleaner, faster playback
* No ads, overlays, or interruptions
* Lightweight desktop tool without the need for browser extensions
